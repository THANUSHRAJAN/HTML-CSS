    <p><b>In the away Border-Gavaskar trophy in 2014, moments after helping India draw the Boxing Day Test at Melbourne, Dhoni announced that he was stepping down from Test captaincy and retiring from Test cricket, citing excessive workload as the reason for quitting the longest format. After honing a potent bowling attack and a gritty batting line-up for his heir, and taking several body blows - literal and metaphorical - Dhoni ensured that he copped the criticism to nurture a potent team and left his successor a young, zealous team with the tenacity, fitness, and most importantly, the positive attitude to perform in all<br><br>

        Dhoni successfully led India to the 2015 World Cup semi-final, where the defending champions conceded cricket’s most desirable trophy to Australia. Here too, Dhoni was the lone-warrior, as he gritted his way through to 65, as his team fell short by 95 runs.<br><br>
        
        On 4th January, 2017 Dhoni stepped down as the captain of the Indian ODI and T20I team, bringing about the end of an era in Indian cricket. Having led the team with zeal and panache across all formats of the game for more than nine years, Dhoni decided to play with the freedom of a pure batsman in his final lap of international cricket without the enormous burden of captaincy.<br><br>
        
        In 2018, with the top order of the Indian team in turbo-mode, MS Dhoni had fewer opportunities to bat and went through an alarming dip in form - the likes of which hadn't been seen since the early days of his international career. With a revised technique and a far more top-handed batting style, Dhoni reinforced his game to suit his waning reactions and wrist strength and continued to be a part of the Indian middle order, guiding younger bowlers, almost handholding the spinners in limited-overs cricket and creating dismissals out of thin air with his lightning-quick stumpings, and almost reinventing the art of wicketkeeping to spinners by eliminating the followthrough at the point of connection.<br><br>
        
        While his chicanery behind the stumps, and the tactical nous to assist the newer leaders may have been priceless for the team, the lack of runs and the declining strike-rate were starting to stand out, leading to his exclusion from T20Is in late 2018. Despite a fantastic IPL 2018, Dhoni has struggled to make his bat do the talking in international cricket of late, as the helicopter stands rusting on the spot it was last seen. After the semifinal heartbreak of the 2019 World Cup, Dhoni did not play an international game for India. On August 15, 2020, just like catches batsmen unaware with his glovework, MS Dhoni surprised the cricketing world by announcing his international retirement through an Instagram post that read, \"Thanks a lot for ur love and support throughout.from 1929 hrs consider me as Retired.<br><br>
        
        The journey started with a run-out and ended with a run-out.<br><br>
        
    
        
        MS Dhoni and Chennai Super Kings is a great yellove story. Ever since the Indian Premier League idea spread vigorously among the cricketing fraternity, people wondered which team would pouch the then Indian captain. The Super Kings, run by an organisation that knew the nuances of running sports, knew they wanted a strong leader to lay a strong base and they made a grand opening by bagging Dhoni for a whopping 6 Crore, the highest bid back then. The IPL would be born on April 18, 2008 and on June 1, Dhoni was there leading CSK in the final, albeit in a losing cause in a final-ball finish.<br><br>
        
        The result may not have gone his way, but he made a mark with his captaincy and by finishing as the side's second highest run-getter. CSK were stopped one step before the final in 2009, but a year later, Dhoni made a quirky move against Kieron Pollard in the final against Mumbai Indians by placing a straightish mid-off despite having a long-off to get his hands on the coveted trophy after two failed attempts. With three consistent years, Dhoni ensured the team made a big mark and they were considered the invincibles of the IPL. CSK justified the tag by winning the title in 2011 and came runners up in the following two editions.<br><br>
        
        Dhoni was the third highest run-getter in 2013, a season where he fought a lone battle against Mumbai in the final. His team team suffered a tough loss in Qualifier 2 against a rampant Kings XI Punjab in 2014, another year where Dhoni scored in excess of 350 runs. 2015 was a black mark in CSK's history as the team was hit by the spot-fixing saga, but Dhoni led the side to the final among the ruckus, before the franchise was slapped with a two-year ban.<br><br>
        
        The ban meant all the CSK players were to spread and Dhoni moved to the newly formed Rising Pune Supergiant in 2016. He spent a quite year, but was back doing what he does best, leading his side to the final, but yet again, finished runners-up in a heart-breaking loss to the Mumbai Indians in the final.<br><br>
        
        2018 was a grand re-entry for Dhoni and CSK. The franchise was given an unimaginably rousing welcome by the fans, who even took a train all the way from Chennai to Pune to support the team as the matches had to be moved out of Chennai. Dhoni was back to where he belonged. He looked fresher, fitter and hungrier. With his brilliant power-hitting through the season, he silenced critics who ever questioning his hitting prowess and made a strong statement that he is still well and truly alive for the 2019 World Cup.<br><br>
        
        After a heart-breaking 1-run loss in the 2019 IPL final to Mumbai, Dhoni led CSK to their 4th title in 2021. Dhoni stepped down from CSK captaincy but he got it back from Ravindra Jadeja after a disastrous 2022 season which saw them not qualify for the playoffs. Dhoni will be back for the 2023 season and will captain the side.</b></p>
